# CodSoft Internship 
It was a great experience tackling some good datasets of Machine Learning and Data Science. 
The dataset really demanded a lot of preprocessing and almost covered the basics we really need to know. 
The Python tkinter questions really made me explore tkinter and learn and implement those in very good applications. <br>

I'd like to thank CodSoft for this wonderful opportunity to upgrade myself with these very nice questions. Here I've attached the tasklist and the corresponding work I performed to tackle the questions.
